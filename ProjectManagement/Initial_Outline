# Initial Outline
### Add-on Ideas

- Line-following
- Camera
- Wireless Communication
- Terrain-capable
- PID Control Line Following (other control tasks too)
- "Rover" - Autonomous
- Dead reckoning
- Kinematics model
- Mecanum/Omniwheels (let's you go weird directions)
- Terrain Mapping - Object Avoidance
- 3D-print chassis
- CAD Model

### Project Requirements
### Project Management
- Tasks
- Responsibilities
- Risks to Tasks and Project
- Gantt Chart
- Project Plan

### Robot Requirements
- Power supply and monitoring
- Chassis body
- Software algorithm, control, telemetry
- Motor Driver board
- Matlab/Simulink simulations
- Storage or memory for camera
- Sensors for goals (IMU, Accelerometer, Proximity/Ultrasonic)
- Telemetry and communication

### Goal statement
Create an autonomous robot capable of exploring, navigating and mapping/ terrain with obstructions.

### Deadlines
13 February Project Proposal
28 March Last day before Spring break
